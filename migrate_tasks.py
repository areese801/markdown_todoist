Code having to do with migrating tasks read from Markdown files into Todoist


Rather than having to try to come up with some tricky way to sync and keep track
of (potentially renamed) files across multiple machines, I decided to
build functionality to 'migrate' tasks into todoist on the fly with a standard
convention to denote those having been migrated.  This approach allows me to
avoid duplications, forget about tracking file names and locations, and
take advantage of the very nature of sync.
