// This is not a valid JSON file, due to the very comments youre reading right
// now. 

// However, the JSON object below is valid. You can use it to make your own
// todoist_api_config.json file. 

// Since the file will contain an API token, which is sensitive, youll need to 
// make damn sure  that you NEVER, EVER put it under version control.  As 
// such, the author of this package Suggests that you do use the name 
// todoist_api_config.json which has a corresponding entry in the
// .gitignore file. 

// Moreover, consider supplying not the API token itself, but a fully qualified 
// path to that token Somewhere on the local machine that is not a part of this
// git repository (or any other..)

// For the paranoid, consider changing the permission bits on that file to 400
// Obviously any other user on the machine with root or sudo permissions will 
// be able to  see the contents of such a file.  If youre not comfortable with
// that notion, then don't is this package on a shared machine in the first
// place. 

// Such is life.  Use your powers for good, not evil.
